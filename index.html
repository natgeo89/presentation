            This technique was originally described in
            1991 by a group of researchers and
            was originally intended to
            timestamp digital documents so
            that it’s not possible to backdate them
            or to tamper with them.

            Here I need to note,
            that Bitcoin is not a Blockchain.
            Blockchain is a technology,
            at same time as Bitcoin
            is just an asset that
            works based on blockchain technology.
            But in presentation I will explain
            some aspects with bitcoin examples.

          <aside class="notes">
            Here I need to say that
            you can imagine blockchain
            just like a type of database.
            But, how does a blockchain differ from a database?
            The answer is the way the data is structured.

          <aside class="notes">
            In classic databases information
            is typically structured in table format
            that allows easy search and filter
            specific information.
            If it's necessary we can easily
            change data inside such database.

          <span>Blockchain</span>
          <aside class="notes">
            A blockchain collects information
            in Blocks, that hold sets of information.
            
            Blocks when filled, are chained
            onto the previously filled block,
            forming a chain of data known
            as the “blockchain.”

            We can say that all blockchains
            are databases
            but not all databases
            are blockchains.

            Blockchain have an interesting
            property: once some
            data has been recorded
            inside a blockchain,
            it becomes very difficult
            to change it.

            and the hash of the previous block.
            The data that is stored inside a block
            depends on the type of blockchain.

          <aside class="notes">
            The Bitcoin blockchain for example stores
            the details about a transaction,
            such as the sender,
            receiver and
            amount of coins.

          <aside class="notes">
            A block also has a hash.
            You can compare a hash to a fingerprint.
            It identifies a block and all of its contents
            and it's always unique, just as a fingerprint.
            Once a block is created,
            hash-function collects all information in this block
            as parameters and calculates block's hash.

            The third important element
            inside each block is
            the hash of the previous block.
            So each block links to the previous block.
            It is how chain of blocks is created.
            Let's look on example.

            As you can see, each block has a hash
            and the hash of the previous block.
            So block number 3 points to block number 2
            and number 2 points to number 1.
            Well, but the first block is a bit special,
            it can't' point to previous blocks
            because it's the first one.
            It calls the genesis block.

            All the nodes in this network create consensus.

            tampered will be rejected
            by other nodes in the network.

            Because of the decentralized nature
            of Bitcoin’s blockchain,
            all transactions can be
            transparently viewed by using
            blockchain explorers that allow
            anyone to see transactions occurring live.
            For example, if you follow this link,
            you can find all bitcoin transactions,
            that has been made since bitcoins's creation in 2009.

            
            Of course you can follow this link on presentation site,

            Let’s start with the most obvious and most
            popular application of blockchains 
            and that is cryptocurrencies. 
            When Bitcoin launched in 2009 it allowed people
            to directly transact with one another 
            without having to trust 
            third parties like banks. 
            Since then over thousand different cryptocurrencies
            have been created.

            If you are a singer, or maybe writer
            or you are creating any another 
            intellectual property
            you can encrypt your document 
            by hash-function,
            receive hash and append 
            this hash into message
            in bitcoin transaction.

            Digital Voting.
            Patents is my favorite example,
            but voting, I think,
            the most important.
            Voting on paper costs a lot of money,
            and can be easily tampered.
            But instead of paper, 
            we could use blockchains
            to cast and store votes. 
            Such a system would be 
            very transparent as
            everyone could verify 
            the voting count for themselves.
            <!-- But here is one problem:
            as I say blockhains are
            transparent, and all information
            about voting will be in the blockhain.
            So, we need to be able to identify voters
            without compromising their privacy.
            But this problem can be solved. -->
